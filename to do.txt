Animation testing

1 idea - add animate class to parent element , then via forEach loop add .show class for all childs
	1. adding .parentAnimate to parent
	2. every child will have animations.

		how to handle animations ?
			every child will have .hidden class at the beginning
			.show when IntersectionObserver intersect.

		what if i have different types of animations ?
			every child will have .hidden class at the beginning;
			when IntersectionObserver intersect element => add (className) to 
			this element, animation name will be passed via data-animation.

			how to access this data-animation property ?
				if(element.getAttribute('data-animation') == '')
